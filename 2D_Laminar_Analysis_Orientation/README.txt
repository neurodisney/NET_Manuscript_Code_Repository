Overview: This collection of code takes the measured orientations of all counted axons and runs a Rayleigh Test. The Rayleigh test is a statistical test commonly used to assess whether a set of circular data (e.g., angles, directions) is uniformly distributed or whether it exhibits a preferred direction (i.e., is unimodal).

Rayleigh_test_plotting: takes the measured orientations of all counted axons read into MATLAB by 'readV1angles.m' and 'readV2angles.m', runs a Rayleigh Test, and generates a polar plot of orientations. The Rayleigh test is a statistical test commonly used to assess whether a set of circular data (e.g., angles, directions) is uniformly distributed or whether it exhibits a preferred direction (i.e., is unimodal).
